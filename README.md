### 🚀 Demo

⸻

### ✨ Features

Drop candles Tap / click on the cake; each click spawns a candle at that spot.

Live counter Text box beneath the cake shows how many candles are currently lit and updates in real-time.

Blowing them out uses web audio mic input to detect a sharp burst of volume (≈ blowing). Fallback Blow! Button appears if mic isn’t available.

Pure front-end vanilla HTML/CSS/JS—no build tools, no backend. Works offline once loaded.
